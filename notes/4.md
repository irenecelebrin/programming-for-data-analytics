Look at tutorials on cleaning data in w3schools and realpython!
Look at everything in the resources 

# video 1: Cleaning data 

dirty data: 
missing values
not uniform
incorrect data types
inconsistent formatters
outliers or noise 
irrelevant data 


Steps: 
get the data
visually look at the data: what is the format, does it looks consistent? Use the descvribe method in pandas, or info 
after you can decide how to move: 
- clean the data manually 
- find and replace with regex
- use pandas and programmatically clean data with regex or removing NaNs

Examples: 
remove blanks 
remove duplicates 
fix data types - strings to numbers / dates 
standardize data - format of teleohone number 
handle outliers 
drop irrelevant data (usually columns)

It's a good idea to export the data to a csv file to look how it looks like, before and after doing your changes 

MISSING VALUES
detect missing values 
print(df.isnull().sum())

**drop NaNs**
df.dropna(inplace=True)

**fill missing values** 
df.fillna(value='default_value', inplace=True)

DUPLICATES 
easy
df.drop_duplicates(inplaxce=True) inplace to to do it in the same dataframe instead of acreating another one 

FIX DATA TYPES 
df['date_column] = pd.to_datetime(df['date_colum])
df['numeric_column'] = pd.to_numeric(df('numeric_column'),errors='coerce')

STANDARDIZE DATA 
strip spaces 
capitalization 
df['name'] = df['name'].str.lower().str.strip()

DROP UNNECESSARY COLUMNS 
df.drop

DEAL WITH OUTLIYING DATA 
do a judgement call 
you can decide to remove it, but it really depends on what your approcah is, and how you want to deal with the problem. 


# Video 2: Introduction to regex 
**Regex** 
aorund since 1951 
useful for finding strings, validating strings, cleaning data, find/replace 

Can be used for 
- grep sed command 
- a lot of text editors 
- most languages have a module for regex (in pyhton the modules is re)

function in python are 
findall
search
split
sub


you can do the changes programmatically but also with grep in the terminal 
grep female people.csv > women.csv 
this commmand selects all the rows with the word 'women' and saves it to a new csv 

# Video 3: Regular expressions tutorial 

re modules: 
- findall(pattern, string)
- search(patterns, string )
- sub(pattern, replacement, string)

often you can modify text on python with the string built-in methods (format, lower, capitalize...)
Sometimes those are not enough and you need to use regex
