## Video 1

What is a url? how to get data from the web? 

with the requests module you can use requests.get(url) to get url API data in json 
see code file: reading from url 

you can do the same with csv files 

data = requests.get(url).text
print(data)

url = universe resource locator
a url can be http https fdp protocols 

the main path of the url is the host: protocol (http) + host (atu.ie)
then, there can be a question mark + parameters (id=123). parameters are separated by ampersand (&)
special characters have special encoding 


**use pandas to read csv file**

you can use df = pd.read_csv(url)

compare pd.read_json 
pandas works much better with csv than json 

aws marketplace in the resources gives much informaition on the data types that you can work with
