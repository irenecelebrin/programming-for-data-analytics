##  1. Date and time in python 

Format of date iin python 

yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss.ssssss

which timezione / locale? 

in programming you want to store time as absolute value, apart from how you represent it. 
This is a timestamp thayt does not change according to timezone or locale. AFter you can set the format to represent this time data. 

the module datetime allows to do it.

**in Pandas**

in US the format is mm/dd/yyyy instead of dd/mm/yyyy. to avoid confusion, it's common to use yyyy/mm/dd/ 
alternate formats can be generated with strftime() and strptime()


you can also use pandas.to_datetime() :  https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.to_datetime.html 


## 2. timeseries in pandas 

getting data from datahub:  https://r2.datahub.io/clt98khox0004ia08zwe4vaqt/main/raw/data/co2-mm-mlo.csv

notebook: https://github.com/andrewbeattycourseware/PFDA-courseware/blob/main/code/Topic06-dates/L2-Timeseries%20in%20pandas.ipynb 

make a datetime colum from index to column 

to skip rows that are not part of the table use skiprows in the pd.read_csv

benefit of using date as index --> you can use pd.loc to select data from a give time interval 

Resample: 
it's possible to resample data based on particular criteria, such as date information
