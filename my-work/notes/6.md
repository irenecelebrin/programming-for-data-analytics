##  1. Date and time in python 

Format of date iin python 

yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss.ssssss

which timezione / locale? 

in programming you want to store time as absolute value, apart from how you represent it. 
This is a timestamp thayt does not change according to timezone or locale. AFter you can set the format to represent this time data. 

the module datetime allows to do it. 
notebook: https://github.com/andrewbeattycourseware/PFDA-courseware/blob/main/code/Topic06-dates/L1-introduction_datetime.ipynb

**in Pandas**

in US the format is mm/dd/yyyy instead of dd/mm/yyyy. to avoid confusion, it's common to use yyyy/mm/dd/ 
alternate formats can be generated with strftime() and strptime()


you can also use pandas.to_datetime() :  https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.to_datetime.html 


## 2. timeseries in pandas 

getting data from datahub:  https://r2.datahub.io/clt98khox0004ia08zwe4vaqt/main/raw/data/co2-mm-mlo.csv

notebook: https://github.com/andrewbeattycourseware/PFDA-courseware/blob/main/code/Topic06-dates/L2-Timeseries%20in%20pandas.ipynb 

make a datetime colum from index to column 

to skip rows that are not part of the table use skiprows in the pd.read_csv

benefit of using date as index --> you can use pd.loc to select data from a give time interval 

Resample: 
it's possible to resample data based on particular criteria, such as date information 

## 3. Pseudo-random numbers 

Using NumPy. Notebook: https://github.com/andrewbeattycourseware/PFDA-courseware/blob/main/code/Topic06-dates/L3-random_number_generation.ipynb 

They are pseduo-random (artifically generated)

you can set the distrution (normal distribution for example)

why random numbers? to generatr fake data, or to play a game, or to test random instances of a sample 

numpy random generator documetnation https://numpy.org/doc/2.2/reference/random/generator.html 

np.random_rng https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generator.html#numpy.random.default_rng
for uniform distribution: np.random.uniform  https://numpy.org/doc/2.3/reference/random/generated/numpy.random.uniform.html 

uniform distribution: https://www.w3schools.com/Python/numpy/numpy_random_uniform.asp 

gaussian distribution: np.random.normal() https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy/numpy_random_normal.asp 

np.random.uniform(low = 0, high = 1, size = 10)

np.random.default_rng( seeds = None)

--> to create a random array that can be repeated and be the same, add the seed paramter. 

## 4. Generating data with poison distribution 

Case study. Notebook: https://github.com/andrewbeattycourseware/PFDA-courseware/blob/main/code/Topic06-dates/L4-creating%20data.ipynb 

Poissont distribution: estimates the chances of something occurring given a ccertain average. 
so you can use poisson to givenerate data that will have a ceertain mean. 
Poisson distrbution takes into account the fact that data cannot be less than 0 (??)

https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy/numpy_random_poisson.asp 

1) get data for every day 

pd.date_rande()

2) create a new df with the dates as index, and as column generate random numbers 

use poisson random generator adding a mean ( let's say 15) and the size of the interval (n. of days in the index )

check what the mean of the interval is 

3) this does not take into account the time of the day 

you can introduce different means based on the time of the day 

create interval for each hour with np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 24) https://numpy.org/doc/2.3/reference/generated/numpy.linspace.html 
--> starting from 0 and goinfg up so that the hightest point is between 0 and 12 

to get the data in a sine and accounting for the mean: np.sin() https://numpy.org/doc/2.3/reference/generated/numpy.sin.html 

make sure the interval includes the same number of elements as the array, otherwise you can't add it to the dataframe. 

why using dynthetic data? it can be useful to use synthetic data before getting to real data, to make sure your analysis works
