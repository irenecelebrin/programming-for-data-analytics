# Lesson 9: Plotting data 

## Video 1: Intro to data visualization 

Data visualization types: 

- plots (charts) --> matplotlib 
- tables (pandas)
- graph (schemas)
- geospatial (on maps)
- infographics: nice ways to present data 
- dashboards : dinamic way to represent data 

- box plots 
- line plots
- scatter plots 
- line between plot 
- stack plot 
- stair plots 
- stem plots 

Also other statistical and 3d plots 

See notebook for plots code with matplotlbi and seaborne 

look at matplotlib plots gallery to get inspiration on plot types you want to create or that could make sense to represent your data. 

https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/index.html 

Other packages for other languages
- Ds3 for javascript 
- ECharts
- Vega
- deck.gl

With Javascript in particular you can do a lot of anymation and dynamic plots, for example a map that highlights and shows data when you click on the state, or plots where the line starts and is projected 

Principle: 
Set the context: why are you plotting the data? Is it a presentation or is it regular data that will change, so a dashboard is better? 
Who is audience
Keep it simple 
Effective visual --> with information with units and legends 

## Video 2: Matplotlib 

Plots can have: major ticks, minorticks, 
title, legend 
all the annotation is in matplotlib 


(to create data: use numpy.arange())

Useful stuff

- matplotlib.axis for a list of the functions possible wioth axes.axes.

- looks at the examples, find something you like and then use it (adjust to your use case)

- formatting numbers (for example, to add money amounts as numbers on one of the axes) --> see notbook 

- you can insert text in the plot to point to a specific part of the plot 

- see anatomy of a figure to get ideas of code for the plots 


## Video 3: Intro to axes 

with subplots() you can use multiple plots 
or subplot_mosaic()
or subfrigure()

nice function to pull different dimentions in the same n-d array (or different columns in the the same pandas dataframe, which is also useful!!)
